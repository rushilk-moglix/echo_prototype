# Cognilix design system (Echo and Clarix)

Neo-minimal base, micro-maximal details. Both products load the same token file, so a colour, size or state means
the same thing in each. This page is for developers changing the UI.

## Files

| What | Echo | Clarix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Shared tokens (keep identical) | `src/ds-tokens.css` | `src/styles/ds-tokens.css` |
| Product layer and accent | `src/styles.css` (top: accent; end: neo-minimal layer) | `src/styles/theme.scss` (accent), `src/styles.scss` (Tailwind bridge, neo-minimal layer) |
| Component recipes | classes in `src/styles.css` (`.btn`, `.card`, `.tag`, `.input`, `.ck`) | mixins in `src/styles/_ds.scss` (`ds.btn`, `ds.card`, `ds.badge`, `ds.input`, `ds.micro-label`, `ds.big-number`, `ds.table-card`) |
| Theme switch | `data-theme="light|dark"` on `<html>` (side bar foot) | `.dark` class on `<html>` (side bar foot) |

Never write a hex colour in a component. Use a token. Charts that need real colours use the chart palette below.

## Colour

| Role | Light | Dark |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Page | `#FFFFFF` white | `#000000` black |
| Cards, panels | `#FFFFFF` with a `#E7E5E2` hairline | `#0C0B0A` with a `#282624` hairline |
| Wells, table heads, empty states | `#F0EEE9` PANTONE 11-4201 Cloud Dancer | `#0C0B0A` |
| Side bar | `#F7F6F3` | `#0A0908` |
| Text | `#0C0A09` | `#F0EEE9` (Cloud Dancer) |
| Secondary, muted, placeholder | `#44403C`, `#5C5752`, `#69635D` | `#D6D3CF`, `#A8A29E`, `#8F8983` |
| Echo accent | `#DA291C` PANTONE 485 C | `#DA291C` (text on black: `#FF8B80`) |
| Clarix accent | `#4C4184` PANTONE 7672 C | `#6A5FC1` (text on black: `#BCB5F5`) |

- Buttons on the accent always use white text.
- Greys are warm stone, so they sit with Cloud Dancer.
- Status colours (`--ds-success|warning|danger|info|neutral` with `-fg`, `-bg`, `-border`) carry meaning only. Text uses the `-fg` tone; dots and bars use the solid tone.
- Chart palette (works on white and black): success `#16A34A`, accent `#6A5FC1` or `#DA291C`, warning `#E28A0B`, danger `#DC2626`, neutral `#A8A29E`.
- Contrast is checked on every page in both themes: text 4.5:1 or more, borders and controls 3:1 or more.

## Type

- Geist for everything; Geist Mono for micro labels, ids, keys and code.
- Sizes: 11, 12, 13 (body), 14, 16, 20, 24, 26 (page title) px. Page titles 650 weight, tight tracking.
- Micro label (the only place for caps): mono, 11 px, 0.07em tracking, muted. Card titles, column heads, stat labels, nav groups.
- Numbers are tabular everywhere (tables, counters, durations). Overview numbers are big (30 px, 650).

## Shape and depth

- Radius 4, 6, 8 (controls), 10 (cards), 14 (modals).
- Cards are flat: hairline border, no shadow. A card that is a link lifts 1 px and gains a soft shadow on hover.
- Shadows are for things that float: menus, popovers, modals, toasts.

## Components

- **Button:** 36 px (30 px small). Primary uses the accent with a hairline top highlight; secondary is white or black with a stone edge; ghost has no edge. Pressing shrinks it slightly. Disabled stays readable.
- **Status badge:** a solid dot, then the word, on a soft tint. Never colour alone. Running states pulse the dot.
- **Input:** white or black field with a stone edge; hover darkens the edge; focus is the accent edge with a soft ring.
- **Table:** Cloud Dancer head with micro labels, hairline rows, quiet hover.
- **Tabs:** text tabs with an ink underline on the active one; segmented controls for views.
- **Modal:** lifts and fades in over a blurred backdrop; Esc and the backdrop close it.
- **Info icon:** opens on hover after a short pause or on focus; closes on leave, Esc, scroll or a click outside; tap pins it on touch.
- **Empty state:** a Cloud Dancer well with a dashed edge, a title, one line and one action.
- **Side bar:** icons when closed, opens on hover, pin handle in the middle. Active page is a white (or black) chip with a hairline and a 3 px accent bar.
- **Agent ready to run checklist (Echo):** one compact line of tick boxes with a count and a small progress bar. A missing item has an amber box; clicking it opens the tab that fixes it. When everything is ticked it reads "Ready to run" in green.

## Motion

- Fast and physical: 80 to 220 ms. Press feedback on buttons, a spring on switches and tick boxes, a lift for modals and menus.
- Nothing moves on its own except live states (a pulsing dot for something running).
- `prefers-reduced-motion` turns animation off everywhere.

## Checks before you merge

1. No hex colours in components (charts excepted).
2. Light and dark at 375, 768 and 1440 px: no clipped text, no sideways page scroll.
3. Contrast: paste `docs/ui-audit.js` into the browser console on every page you touched, in both themes.
4. Keyboard: every action reachable, a visible focus ring, Esc closes popovers and modals.
